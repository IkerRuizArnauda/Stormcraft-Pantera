StormCraft Standard Realm List Server

StormCraft realm list servers allow any public server to send a heartbeat to be listed.  The  heartbeat must be received in less than 150 second intervals for the server to remain listed (every 60 seconds is recommended).

Four pieces of data are required by the realm list server:
Name - Your server should have a unique name
IP Address - Your numeric IP address (leave this BLANK to make the realm list determine your IP address)
Port - The port for the initial connection, usually 9090.
Number of Players - The current number of players connected

The packet of data sent must be formatted like so:
Port - 16-bit unsigned in little endian (this means you do not ntohs this on little endian machines)
Padding - 16-bits of padding.  The structure expected is 4-byte aligned, so there are two bytes following the Port that are unused.
Name - Null-terminated string, fixed total length is 64 bytes.  Whether your name is 64 bytes including the null terminator or not, it must be 64 bytes in the packet.
IP Address - Null-terminated string, fixed total length is 16 bytes.  Same as Name but 64 bytes including the null terminator.
Number Players - 32-bit unsigned in little endian.
Total size: 88 bytes (2+2+64+16+4)

In C (4-byte aligned):
struct RealmPacket
{
	unsigned short Port;
	char Name[64];
	char IPAddr[16];
	unsigned long nPlayers;
};


This information must be sent via UDP (SO_DGRAM, connectionless, use sendto) to port 9111 of a realm list server.  If the size received is not exactly 88 bytes, it will be ignored.
