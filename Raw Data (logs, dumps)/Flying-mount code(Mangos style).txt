Basic rewrite of code above(mangos-style to pantera)
//fly
CPacket pkg;
pkg.Reset(835);
pkg << guid << (unsigned long)2;
pClient->Send(&pkg);

//land
CPacket pkg;
pkg.Reset(836);
pkg << guid << (unsigned long)5;
pClient->Send(&pkg);

//change speed
CPacket pkg;
pkg.Reset(897);
pkg  << guid << (unsigned long)0 << (float)ASpeed;
pClient->Send(&pkg);
